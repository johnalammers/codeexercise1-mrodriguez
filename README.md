# C# Coding Assessment - Instructions
For this exercise, we'd like you to look at some code. Consider the code in this repo to be written by a junior engineer who you're helping. It is, by design, limited in terms of functional scope. However, the goal is to produce a piece of code that follows good software engineering practices. 

Please take a look at the C# source files. Make whatever changes you feel are necessary or desirable. Unlike a bugfix, your goal is not to make the smallest possible change but to fix whatever merits improvement. This fork is yours to change as you see fit. When you're done, create a pull request, and we'll schedule time (if we've not already) for you to walk us through the changes you've made and your rationale behind them.

Finally, please don't share this code with anyone else.
